# BubbleRubricBuilder

This code is intended to enable more efficient rubric generation for academic and similar assessments. The code uses supplied lists of participants and teams to create rubrics in PDF form that can be printed, scanned, and automatically analyzed to produce sharable results to participants and potentially used for institutional research. Alternatively, the forms may be filled electronically, collected, and analyzed.

Goals of the project are to:
* Streamline the creation of rubric forms
* Encourage higher participation by providing electronic and printed options
* Reduce burden of evaluator from filling in known information such as team and member names
* Streamline analysis of results to get feedback to those evaluated faster and reduce effort of the administrator of the evaluation

## Team Presentation Rubric
* In Progress

From a list of participants and team membership, and a list of criteria, this code will:
* Generate a PDF with the team rubric and individual presenter rubrics that can be printed and filled
* Scan and compile team and individual results using OCR and iamge processing
* Generate PDFs for individual feedback
* Generate spreadsheet with complete feedback for institutional research

_Note: All students, scores, and teams are fictional_

## Team 360 Evaluation Rubric
* Coming soon

From a list of participants and team membership, and a list of criteria, this code will:
* Generate a PDF with the 360 evaluation for each participant that can be printed and filled
* Scan and compile team and individual results using OCR and iamge processing
* Generate PDFs for individual feedback
* Generate spreadsheet with complete feedback for institutional research

## Course Evaluation Rubric
* Coming soon
